# growth_rate_simulations_public
IMPORTANT: Readers should refer to the README_simulation_outline.pdf file for details. 
These scripts study the growth of populations of cells, both for a current theory project 
studying the growth rate of an asymmetrically dividing cells, and for the publication 
"Cell size regulation in budding yeast does not depend on linear accumulation of Whi5".
